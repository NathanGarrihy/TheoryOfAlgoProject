## Introduction
As part of my final year Theory Of Algorithms module for B.Sc.(Hons) in Software Development, 
I had to write a program in the C programming language to calculate the SHA512 value of an input file. 
We were asked to ensure the program has the following functionality:

* The program must take the name or path of the file as a command line
argument and output the SHA512 digest of it. 
* The program must be coded from scratch
* We cannot use any external libraries other than what is included in the C standard library.
* Must compile using 'gcc' or 'clang'
* The program must include a Makefile which compiles it upon make being called in the project folder.
* It must also include tests which run upon 'make test' being called

## Description

## Compilation instructions


## What the SHA512 algorithm is and why it's important


# Questions:
## Why can't we reverse the SHA512 algorithm to retrieve the original message from a hash digest?

## Can you design an algorithm that, given enough time, will find input messages that give each of the possible 512-bit strings?

## How difficult is it to find a hash digest beginning with at least twelve zeros?
