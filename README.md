## What the SHA512 algorithm is and why it's important


# Questions:
## Why can't we reverse the SHA512 algorithm to retrieve the original message from a hash digest?

## Can you design an algorithm that, given enough time, will find input messages that give each of the possible 512-bit strings?

## How difficult is it to find a hash digest beginning with at least twelve zeros?
